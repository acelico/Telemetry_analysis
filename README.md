This project entails the identification of the most problematic devices within a telemetry system for solar energy applications.
When some device (e.g. a battery) is experiencing problems sends an alarm. Based on the alarms, it is possible to identify which are the most problematic devices and what is their most relevant problem. 
The analysis is based on the uptime (and corresponding downtime) calculation of each device. 
Uptime is calculated on 24 hours periods on 15 minutes time windows.
